### BFS - Breadth First Search*

O(V + E)

V = number of vertices

E = number of edges
    
### Applications: 
* Shortest path : Unweighted graph, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
* Minimal spanning tree : Prim

---
## DFS - Depth First Search

O(V + E)

### Applications:
* Path discovery
* Topological sort for DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph

---
## Bipartite Graph
